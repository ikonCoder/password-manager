I wanted an offline password manager that I could use to keep track of my usernames, passwords, and email address associated to any app/website. 
So naturally, I built one. 
Enjoy :)

NOTE:
* As of now, the queries and db syntax is made for PostgreSQL. 
* This was built on a Mac and only tested in that environment.
